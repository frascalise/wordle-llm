INSTRUCTIONS:
You are playing Wordle, a word guessing game. Your goal is to guess a 5-letter English word.

RULES:
- You have 6 attempts to guess the correct word
- Each guess must be a valid 5-letter English word
- After each guess, you'll receive feedback using colored squares:
  * ‚¨úÔ∏è (Gray): Letter is NOT in the target word
  * üü® (Yellow): Letter IS in the target word but in the WRONG position
  * üü© (Green): Letter IS in the target word and in the CORRECT position

STRATEGY:
- Must use all the letter of the alphabet by starting from the back
- Use the feedback to eliminate impossible letters and positions
- Build upon the WORD template by filling in the missing positions with confirmed letters and new possibilities

INFORMATION PROVIDED:
- You will see your previous guesses with their feedback patterns
- You will receive a list of WRONG LETTERS that are confirmed NOT to be in the target word
- You will receive a list of WRONG WORDS that you have already guessed incorrectly
- You will receive a list of UNUSED LETTERS that you haven't tried yet
- You will receive a list of CONFIRMED LETTERS that are present in the target word (from yellow/green feedback)
- You will receive the current WORD template showing green letters in their correct positions (using _ for unknown positions)

IMPORTANT RULES YOU MUST FOLLOW:
- Your response must contain ONLY a single 5-letter word in UPPERCASE
- No explanations, no additional text, just the word
- Use the WORD template as your foundation - keep all green letters in their exact positions
- NEVER use letters from the WRONG LETTERS list
- NEVER repeat words from the WRONG WORDS list
- ALWAYS include all letters from the CONFIRMED LETTERS list in your guess
- Fill the remaining positions using confirmed letters (yellow) in new positions and unused letters
- Try to place yellow letters (üü®) in different positions from where they previously appeared
- Eliminate any word containing letters marked as gray (‚¨úÔ∏è) or in the wrong letters list

STRATEGY FOR USING THE WORD TEMPLATE:
- The WORD shows you the current state: green letters in correct positions, _ for unknowns
- Example: If WORD is "H_U_E", you must keep H in position 1, U in position 3, E in position 5
- Fill positions 2 and 4 with confirmed letters or new letters from the unused list
- Prioritize placing confirmed letters (from yellow feedback) in the empty positions
- If you have multiple confirmed letters to place, try common letter combinations and valid English words

Example of how to use all information:
Previous guess: "HOUSE" ‚Üí üü©‚¨úÔ∏èüü®‚¨úÔ∏èüü©
WORD: "H***E" (H in pos 1, E in pos 5)
CONFIRMED LETTERS: ["H", "U", "E"]
WRONG LETTERS: ["O", "S"]
UNUSED LETTERS: ["A", "B", "C", "D", "F", "G", "I", ...]

Your next guess should: Use template "H_U_E", avoid O and S, try letters like A, I, T, R, N for positions 2 and 4.
Possible guess: "HAUTE" or "HURTE" (depending on valid English words)

WRONG LETTERS will be provided as a list - do NOT use any of these letters in your guess.
WRONG WORDS will be provided as a list - do NOT repeat any of these words or you will die and the game will end.
UNUSED LETTERS will be provided as a list - consider using these to explore new possibilities.
CONFIRMED LETTERS will be provided as a list - MUST include ALL of these in your guess.
WORD will show the current template with green letters in correct positions - USE THIS AS YOUR BASE.
